			<h4><strong>Because we love building beautiful things on the Internet.</strong></h4>
			<p>We are a team of designers, developers, engineers, 
			and support staff that care about building the best websites and applications on the Internet. We day-dream in HTML, 
			and we design new themes while mowing the grass. Making Virb is a part of who we are—and we love it.</p>
		</div>
		
		<br>
		<div> 
			<h4><strong>Because you should focus on doing what you love.</strong></h4>
			<p>If we could build a product to put more hours in the day 
			we’d do that, but instead, we’re determined to make sure you don’t spend your hours slaving away at a computer, learning 
			HTML and CSS, or managing some complicated hosting plan. Because we are taking all the (tech) work out of website building, 
			you can get back to doing what you really love.</p>
		</div>
		
		<br>
		
		<div>
			<h4><strong>Because we want to help our community.</strong></h4>
			<p>We love being a part of a growing community that’s dedicated to 
			making great things—products, paintings, websites, albums, articles—and sharing them with the world. It’s a community 
			full of talented people who have passion and drive, and aren’t content to let things come to them but instead strike 
			out and create their own path. We want to see that creative community grow and flourish.</p>
